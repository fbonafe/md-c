#Molecular Dynamics

Graphic interface for Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics. Need to proportion: number of particles, time step, number of steps, particle density or initial distancebetween particles, cut of radius, epsilon and sigma parameters or Lennard-Jones potencial, initial velocity distribution and number of procesors.

Minimal c core for Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics. Extended and ported to Python.

This program can calculate total energy, potencial energy, cinetic energy and temperature vs time. It also gives a real time plot of this four things.
