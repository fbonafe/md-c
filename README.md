#Molecular Dynamics in Python

GUI for Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics. User should input: number of particles, time step, number of steps, particle density or initial distancebetween particles, cutoff radius, epsilon and sigma parameters or Lennard-Jones potential, initial velocity distribution and number of processors.

Based on minimal C core for Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics by Pablo Alcain, extended and ported to Python.

This program can calculate total energy, potencial energy, kinetic energy and temperature vs time. It also shows a real time plot of this four variables.
